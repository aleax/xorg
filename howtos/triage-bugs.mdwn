# How to triage bugs

## Packaging bugs or upstream bugs?

It’d be nice to get all upstream bugs tagged as such (`upstream` tag),
forwarded upstream (<http://bugs.freedesktop.org/> for most packages),
and marked as such.

A mail to `control@bugs.debian.org` would look like:

    tag X upstream
    forwarded X https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=Y
    thanks

Then [`bts-link`](http://bts-link.alioth.debian.org/) comes into play
and help us tracking upstream status, which is pretty nice to have.


## Usertags

Another feature of the BTS is usertagging. That lets people keep track
of additional tags, “attached” to a given mail address. For XSF,
that’s `debian-x@lists.debian.org`.

The list of all usertagged bugs can be seen on:
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?users=debian-x@lists.debian.org>;
the list of all used usertags is at the bottom, in the form.

Let’s give some examples:

 * `i810`, `i915`: helps triaging `-video-intel` bugs depending on the
   chipset.
 * `r200`, `r300`: ditto for `-video-ati`.
 * `xset`, `xrandr`: helps triaging `x11-xserver-utils` bugs depending
   on the affected tool (like other `x11-*` packages, that’s a bundle
   of teeny tiny apps).
 * `squeeze-candidate`: helps keeping a list of bugs we’d like to get
   fixed in a point release (through a stable update).

Here’s an example of URL, for the last tag:
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?users=debian-x@lists.debian.org&tag=squeeze-candidate>

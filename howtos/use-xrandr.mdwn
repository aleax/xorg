# How to use xrandr

## What is xrandr?

`xrandr` is a command-line tool to interact with the X `RandR`
extension [see [x.org](http://www.x.org/wiki/Projects/XRandR),
[wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RandR)], which allows for
live (re)configuration of the X server (*i.e.* without restarting it):
It provides automatic discovery of modes (resolutions, refresh rates,
etc.) together with the ability to configure outputs dynamically
(resize, rotate, move, etc.).

**FIXME: Status across drivers?**

## What about xorg.conf?

Starting with `squeeze`, removing the `xorg.conf` configuration file
entirely should work well enough, but in case that doesn’t work out,
let’s document what can be removed from it from a `RandR` point of
view.

### Mode detection

With the driver detecting modes automatically, several configuration
options become useless most of the time in your configuration file
(xorg.conf). You might want to remove:

 * `HorizSync` and `VertRefresh` from the `Monitor` section.
 * Modes from `Display` subsection in `Screen` section.
 * `ModeLine` from the `Monitor` section.

# How to use xrandr

## What is xrandr?

`xrandr` is a command-line tool to interact with the X `RandR`
extension [see [x.org](http://www.x.org/wiki/Projects/XRandR),
[wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RandR)], which allows for
live (re)configuration of the X server (*i.e.* without restarting it):
It provides automatic discovery of modes (resolutions, refresh rates,
etc.) together with the ability to configure outputs dynamically
(resize, rotate, move, etc.).

**FIXME: Status across drivers?**

## What about xorg.conf?

Starting with `squeeze`, removing the `xorg.conf` configuration file
entirely should work well enough, but in case that doesn’t work out,
let’s document what can be removed from it from a `RandR` point of
view.

### Mode detection

With the driver detecting modes automatically, several configuration
options become useless most of the time in your configuration file
(xorg.conf). You might want to remove:

 * `HorizSync` and `VertRefresh` from the `Monitor` section.
 * Modes from `Display` subsection in `Screen` section.
 * `ModeLine` from the `Monitor` section.

### Static dual-head configuration

 * Drop dual `Device`/`Screen`/`Monitor` sections, a single one is
   needed.
 * Drop `MonitorLayout` option and `Screen` lines from the remaining
   `Device` section.
 * Drop the `ServerLayout` section(s).
 * Drop `RightOf`/`LeftOf` indication of the remaining `Screen` line
   in `ServerLayout` section.

## Using xrandr

### Basics


Once the configuration file (`xorg.conf`) is removed or updated,
starting the server should enable some outputs by default. Their
top-left corners will be at the same part of the image, but their
modes will probably be different.

All outputs may be configured through `xrandr`. To see the available
outputs, just run `xrandr`:

    $ xrandr
    Screen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1280 x 800, maximum 4096 x 4096
    VGA1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
    LVDS1 connected 1280x800+0+0 inverted X and Y axis (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 261mm x 163mm
       1280x800       59.8*+
       1024x768       60.0
       800x600        60.3     56.2
       640x480        59.9
    DVI1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
    TV1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)

Comments:

 * We see 4 outputs: `VGA1`, `LVDS1`, `DVI1`, `TV1`.
 * Only the internal panel (`LVDS1`) is connected and it supports 4
   modes at 60 Hz, 1 mode at 56 Hz.
 * The mode marked with a star (`*`) is the current mode.
 * The one marked with a plus (`+`) is the preferred one. Most
   monitors report a preferred mode to the driver. And the
   server/driver will generally choose it by default.

**FIXME: Mention output name conventions?**

When manipulating `VGA1` output properties, you should use:

    $ xrandr --output VGA1 <options>

### Adding/removing heads dynamically

The old days where you had to restart X when plugging a new monitor
are gone. With `RandR` 1.2, you can plug/unplug monitors whenever you
want. Running the following line will query all outputs and enable
them with their default mode:

    $ xrandr --auto

You may also disable one output using:

    $ xrandr --output LVDS1 --off

This may be useful for some buggy application that don’t support
multiple outputs well. Also, due to CRTC limitations (see the Caveats
section below), it is often required to disable one output before
enabling another since most hardware only support 2 at the same time.

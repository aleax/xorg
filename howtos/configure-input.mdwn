# How to configure input

## Rules of thumb

In this documentation, only the last part of the driverâ€™s name will be
mentioned, all of them are under the `xserver-xorg-input-*` namespace.

 * On Linux, `evdev` is used for both keyboard and mouse
   input. `synaptics` can be used to benefit from extra features; it
   takes precedence over `evdev` automatically if both are installed.
 * On GNU/kFreeBSD and GNU/Hurd, `kbd` handles the keyboard and
   `mouse` handles mice, unsurprisingly.

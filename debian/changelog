    (Closes: #446441, LP: #174311)

  [ David Nusinow ]
  * Don't write the default depth to xorg.conf any more.
    The drivers should choose the appropriate depth by default now.
  * Don't bother with resolutions in xorg.conf
    We now rely on the server and drivers to do the right thing. Previously,
    our best-case scenario was to have the xserver-xorg postinstall script ask
    the monitor what the optimal values were, and if that wasn't possible to
    give the user a default list of resolutions and a best-guess hsync and
    vrefresh values that the user could override. The server and almost all
    drivers will do this on boot anyway using properly maintained code, which
    allows them to better adapt to changes. randr 1.2-compliant drivers will
    do this even better than we possibly could. Finally, the server will
    provide a better list of defaults than we were doing anyway. There will
    undoubtedly be bugs uncovered by this change, but we need  to find and fix
    the actual bugs in the drivers and server in order to move forward.
    + Don't recommend xresprobe any more
    + Don't recommend laptop-detect any more or look for it in server postinst
  * Don't set fbdev in the postinst for r128 on ppc.

    - Stop handling -config specifically in the wrapper, as Xorg now
      handles this itself.
  * local/dexconf, control:
    - Added support for vmmouse_detect (if present) to override mouse
      driver with vmware. Depends on mdetect.
  * local/dexconf:
    - Add extra bits for ps3fb xorg.conf.
  * local/dexconf, xserver-xorg.templates:
    - Read xserver-xorg/config/device/extra_options key, parse it
      (first token is option name, rest of the line after first space
      is value), and add it as Option lines to the device section.
  * scripts/vars.{amd64,i386}:
    - Install both xserver-xorg-video-intel AND xserver-xorg-video-i810,
      instead of OR.
  * scripts/vars.i386:
    - Add xserver-xorg-video-amd and xserver-xorg-video-psb.
  * scripts/vars.lpia:
    - Copied from vars.i386.
  * local/Xsession:
    - If ~/.xsession-errors is bigger than 0.5MiB, truncate it to the last
      0.5MiB to avoid having it grow indefinitively. (This does not happen
      with gdm anyway since gdm cleans the file on login).
  * xserver-xorg.postinst.in:
    - Make sure to ask video driver on sparc even if autodetected. Some
      cards still require weird overrides (ati -> fbdev) that are not
      100% known in all combinations.
    - Skip video card autodetection if xforcevesa is set.

    + Will be set to "auto" protocol by default. This will let the driver
      choose the correct protocol automatically. The kernel driver multiplexes
      different protocols through the same /dev/input/mice device file,
      allowing this. Only in pathological cases will you need to work around
      it.
  * Don't specify the device section to use in the screen section

    - Fix issue when running failsafeXserver directly, not through gdm,
      where SIGSTOP was emitted to the parent process.  Now only do this
      if the parent process is gdm.
    - Fix issue on hardware that can't do DRI.  We had been unable to

    - debian/control:
      + Keep meta-packages for xbase-clients, xutils.
      + Change the Maintainer-field.
      + Add replaces for xinit since we now ship Xsession from x11-common.
        Ditto for xrgb as we ship rgb.txt in x11-common.
      + xserver-xorg: Add dependancy "OR xserver-xorg-video" because

        "False" in Device Section in dexconf if the above combination is
        matched otherwise the card will display extra unrequired info each

      + Due to a very annoying DRI/DRM bug, make sure to use OldDmaInit
        when writing down the Device section for mga driver. This will make
        DRI work at least for AGP cards. PCI didn't work before and it will

        not being able to get a clue on the connected monitor. (LP #30489)
      + Some ati cards require a kick (sync ranges) when using DVI output.

        course the drivers pick up the wrong one. (LP #38772)
      + On fresh installs, if the display is not a lcd/lvds, there are no
        known syncs frequencies for the monitor and the card is mga, do NOT
        write SYNC_RANGES. It appears that mga can cope just fine parting
        vesa info too. (LP #19098)
    - debian/xserver-xorg.templates:

        We need this in restricted-manager to make restricted drivers like
        nvidia work OOTB for compiz, but it is certainly useful for other
        things, too. (NB that the question is never asked interactively).
    - debian/apport/xorg-server.py, debian/x11-common.install: apport
      hook for xorg-server crashes.

  * Xsession.d/*: change 'which' -> '/usr/bin/which', since the zsh builtin
    command can in some circumstances make the login fail.

  [ Christian Perrier ]
  * Debconf translations:
    - Vietnamese. Closes: #426978, #427180

  [ David Nusinow ]
  * Get rid of all the explicit modes by default. They just bloated the
    default config for no reason.
    + The /config/display/modes now has no default (blank). As a result of
      this, under normal conditions, this multi-select field will be empty.
      The debconfage and dexconf will not fill in this section at all. The
      server will then choose the highest resolution that it can probe with
      DDC. This should work for most people, who are probably choosing their
      best resolution anyway. If xresprobe is available and used, the
      resolutions it finds will be selected. Until there is a good way for the
      server to store this information by itself, we should leave this as it
      is. Most people can get by without this section, but it'll help some of
      those with broken hardware.
    + If the user does select a mode or modes for this question, dexconf no
      longer iterates through a set of depths and puts the mode list in for
      each. Instead, if dexconf does find a set of specified modes, it will
      write a single "Display" subsection for the screen, and it will contain
      the modes. This is functionally equivalent to what we were doing anyway,
      and it cuts down the number of lines in our xorg.conf considerably.

xorg (1:7.2-3ubuntu1) gutsy; urgency=low

  * Merge from Debian unstable. Remaining changes:
    - debian/control, debian/scripts/vars.sparc, debian/rules:
      + Makes xorg Architecture: any and use an extra variable
        to not Depends on type-handling.
    - debian/control:
      + Keep meta-packages for xbase-clients, xutils.
      + Change the Maintainer-field.
      + Add replaces for xinit since we now ship Xsession from x11-common.
        Ditto for xrgb as we ship rgb.txt in x11-common.
      + xserver-xorg: Add dependancy "OR xserver-xorg-video" because
        the restricted drivers provide that.
    - debian/local/Xsession:
      + If ~/.xsession-errors is bigger than 0.5MiB, truncate it to the last
        0.5MiB to avoid having it grow indefinitively. (This does not happen
        with gdm anyway since gdm cleans the file on login). (LP: #60448)
    - debian/local/dexconf:
      + Uncoditionally re-enable ZAxisMapping in dexconf. (LP: #31827)
      + Add InputDevice entries for wacom.
      + Add extra bits for ps3fb xorg.conf.
      + Read xserver-xorg/config/device/extra_options key, parse it
        (first token is option name, rest of the line after first space
        is value), and add it as Option lines to the device section.
        (LP: #90109)
      + Add special case for i810 with 3M TouchScreen monitors to set a
        resolution of 800x600 and avoid probing since it will fail miserably
        in xserver-xorg.postinst. Also make sure to write Option "DisplayInfo"
        "False" in Device Section in dexconf if the above combination is
        matched otherwise the card will display extra unrequired info each
        time X attempts a startup. (touches also xserver-xorg.postinst.in)
      + Due to a very annoying DRI/DRM bug, make sure to use OldDmaInit
        when writing down the Device section for mga driver. This will make
        DRI working at least for AGP cards. PCI didn't work before and it will
        keep not working since the option does explicitly disable DRI for PCI.
        (LP: #27442)
      + Enable elographics driver when matching known machines.
      + Disable composite when using the fglrx driver. It does not support
        composition, and enabling it by default (as recently done in
        xorg-server) breaks DRI for fglrx. (LP: #90688)
    - debian/scripts/vars.i386:
      + Add xserver-xorg-input-elographics to XSERVER_XORG_INPUT_DEPENDS.
    - debian/xserver-xorg.postinst.in:
      + Add lt to list of non-Latin keymaps (LP: #38931).
      + Make sure to ask video driver on sparc even if autodetected. Some
        cards still require weird overrides (ati -> fbdev) that are not
        100% known in all combinations.
      + Skip video card autodetection if xforcevesa is set
        (LP #27020, #59618).
      + Detect keyboard layout configuration using /etc/default/console-setup
        if available.
      + Clean up duplicate keymaps in xserver-xorg.config.in and make sure
        they're all neatly alphabetised.
      + Map cf console keymap to ca(fr).
      + Map croat console keymap to hr. (LP: #43598)
      + Set default keyboard variant for French to oss (LP: #89835).
      + Map et console keymap to ee. (LP: #42800)
      + Map mk console keymap to mk.
      + Map nl console keymap to nl. (LP: #26552)
      + Map ru console keymap to ru.
      + Map slovene console keymap to si. (LP: #27509)
      + Map sr-cy console keymap to map to cs, not sr, following
        xkeyboard-config changes.
      + Handle trfu/trqu console keymaps the same way as trf/trq.
        (LP #37867)
      + Map uk console keymap to gb, not gb(intl). (LP: #58016)
      + Try autodetecting South Korean keyboards.  They have to be detected
        from LANG since they use US keymaps on the console.
      + Fix sanity-checking logic for French Canadian vs. US-layout
        keyboards. (LP: #34627)
      + Sparc doesn't need sun types keyboard since 2.6 kernel come to play
        in the game. Make it use pc105 instead with xorg rules.
      + Use fbset for HPPA.
      + Write down sync ranges for sis driver. Too many reports on sis driver
        not being able to get a clue on the connected monitor. (LP: #30489)
      + Some ati cards require a kick (sync ranges) when using DVI output.
        (LP: #39570)
      + Make sure to write sync values for Intel Corporation 82852/855GM
        Integrated Graphics Device when monitor is LCV/LDVS.
        (LP: #13846)
      + Write sync values for Intel Mobile 945GM. (LP: #62002)
      + Make sure to write sync ranges with CTX S501A LCD monitor since it
        seems to return 2 sets of sync ranges but only one is valid and of
        course the drivers pick up the wrong one. (LP: #38772)
      + On fresh installs, if the display is not a lcd/lvds, there are no
        known syncs frequencies for the monitor and the card is mga, do NOT
        write SYNC_RANGES. It appears that mga can cope just fine parting
        vesa info too. (LP: #19098)
    - debian/xserver-xorg.templates:
      + Add xserver-xorg/config/device/extra_options so that extra graphics
        driver options can be set through debconf and respected by dexconf.
        We need this in restricted-manager to make restricted drivers like
        nvidia work OOTB for compiz, but it is certainly useful for other
        things, too. (NB that the question is never asked interactively).
  * debian/control:
    - Drop xlibs-dev, since no package Build-depends on it anymore
      (other than via alternatives).
  * debian/rules:
    - Drop change in SERVERABIVER, not used anywhere.
  * debian/xserver-xorg.links:
    - Drop the symlink "usr/share/X11/fonts -> usr/share/fonts/X11", since
      the server default path is correct and always used now.

  * Don't write the DRI section to xorg.conf. We now ship a default mode in

  * Don't write the files section of xorg.conf by default. If the user does
    want to write the files section, don't write out any font paths, only
    write out the font server bit if they specify that.

  * Fix the currently broken sparc hardware detection in config and
    postinst scripts:
    - introduce a new discover_sparc_video() function which uses prtconf
      rather than discover to do the hardware detection. discover does not
      support detection of devices attached to UPA and SBUS buses, common
      on sparc, so it's pretty useless there.
    - use this function on sparc by introducing the DISCOVER_PROG and
      DISCOVER_FUNC variables, preserving the old behavior for all other
      arches. Adjust the debugging messages appropriately.
    - set the default sparc driver to 'sunffb'.
    - set default keyboard rules for sparc to 'xorg' instead of obsolete
      'sun'. The keyboard layer in 2.6 kernels have been unified across
      all arches, so 'xorg' is the correct setting now.
    - add 'cfb' and 'cfb32' to the list of modules loaded by default on
      sparc, since the symbols provided by them are required by sunffb
      driver. Closes: #352869, #377809

  * Add x11-common conflicts with monolithic versions of xserver-xorg. This
    will prevent the modular packages from screwing up old installations due
    to a partial install. Thanks Steve Langasek.
  * Add xlibs-static-dev transitional metapackage

 -- David Nusinow <dnusinow@debian.org>  Sun, 26 Mar 2006 19:18:31 -0500

xorg (1:7.0.6) experimental; urgency=low

  * At the urgent request of the release and ftp teams, xlibs must die. Have
    the xserver-xorg package recommend xkb-data instead. xkb-data should
    already be pulled in by several pieces including the xorg metapackage,
    xutils, and xbase-clients
  * Double the font compatibility symlink. One set at /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts
    and one at /usr/lib/X11/fonts. Both point to /usr/share/fonts/X11, which
    is our home for the fonts.

xorg (1:7.0.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * xorg depends on libgl1-mesa-glx now instead of the ubuntu package name.
    Thanks anonymous dude on my blog who should have used reportbug instead.
  * Provide compatibility packages for the Xorg 6.9 mesa packages. This
    package will be the only source of mesa packages in Debian for the
    present, and these packages will provide for smooth upgrades and
    compatibility.
  * Provide versioned dependencies for all the stuff xorg depends on.

xorg (1:7.0.0) experimental; urgency=low

  * First upload to Debian
  * Add an epoch due to idiocy while working on aborted experimental packages
  * This is a Debian-native package so version it accordingly
  * Remove xbase-clients and xutils metapackages. We're just bundling the apps
    in to one big source package right now
  * Convert to xsfbs
    + shell-lib.sh deleted in favor of xsfbs/xsfbs.sh
    + use targets for script generation and such from xsfbs/xsfbs.mk
  * Change driver metapackage naming to match individual packages:
    + xserver-xorg-driver -> xserver-xorg-video
    + Update the packaging variables that define arch-specific drivers to
      include in the metapackage as well to match these names
  * Remove extra depends on x11-common from xserver-xorg
  * Add debconf dependency for xserver-xorg
  * setuid for /usr/bin/X (stolen from monolith's debian/rules)
  * Provide xlibs and xlibs-data transitional packages. These are empty
    packages that depend on the packages that replace them.
  * Create an xorg metapackage that provides x-window-system(-core). This is a
    simpler name and should suffice. We don't need this split between -system
    and -system-core. If people want twm and so forth they can install it.
    This package installs -core plus xterm currently.
  * Re-add x-window-system-dev package under the new name of xorg-dev. Note to
    packagers: this is not meant to be build-dep'ed on, but is a convenience
    package for users.
  * Provide a compatibility symlink to /usr/lib/X11/fonts (their new home) at
    /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts. This will let external fonts work as expected.
    Thanks Eugene Konev.

    needed can be done in-place.
  * Add seconds to the backup xorg.conf file's name, so you can do multiple
    reconfigures in the same minute.
  * Remove language -> keymap 'smarts'.
  * Make xserver-xorg depend on either the full set of drivers
    (xserver-xorg-driver-all, xserver-xorg-input-all), or any individual
    driver (xserver-xorg-driver, xserver-xorg-input).
  * Remove all dependencies on -driver-atimisc, as it is part of -ati.
  * Nuke irrelevant history section and segue into xf86cfg description from
    dexconf's manpage, update XF86Config-4 references to talk about xorg.conf
    instead.
  * Remove code which checked if a given directory didn't exist ... right
    after it ensured it had been created.
  * Change default mouse protocol to ExplorerPS/2 (closes: Ubuntu#4106).
  * Remove support in dexconf for CID fonts, since mkcfm is wildly non-free.
  * Remove support for ZAxisMapping.
  * Ensure GLcore is removed from the module list when upgrading.
  * Remove XFree86 history spiel from x11-common description.
  * Add /usr/X11R6/bin/X -> /usr/bin/X link.
  * Ask the 'which server?' question at priority low.
  * Remove hppa's hardcoded null _INPUT_DEPENDS, as the libdl-based loader has
    dragged the rest of this architecture kicking and screaming into 1983.
    Unfortunately LaMont is still stuck in 1975, but you can't expect me to
    fix that.

    was lost on some upgrades. This patch by Fabio.
  * Don't force people to select resolution modes. Previously, if none were
    selected, a loop would be entered until some were. This turned out to be
    buggy, but it should not be in place anyway. I've removed the loop, so
    that if the user selects no modes, dexconf won't write the section to
    xorg.conf and the server will be left to its own nefarious devices. Thanks

  * In the config script, munge the source package version into the upstream
    version so we can tell Discover what to look for.  Discover's data is
    based on the upstream version number, not the Debian package's, so strip
    the Debian revision and the (ugh!) epoch.  The introduction of the epoch
    caused the config script to start passing Discover a data version that
    wouldn't match anything, because the epoch is not part of the upstream
    version number.  Thanks to Thomas Lange for diagnosing this bug!

  [ Jurij Smakov ]
  * Remove xserver-xorg-video-{newport,tga} from XSERVER_XORG_VIDEO_DEPENDS
    on sparc, since these drivers do not built on sparc (sparc is not in
    the arch list). Thanks to Julien Cristau for pointing it out.
  * Fix the currently broken sparc hardware detection in config and
    postinst scripts:
    - introduce a new discover_sparc_video() function which uses prtconf
      rather than discover to do the hardware detection. discover does not
      support detection of devices attached to UPA and SBUS buses, common
      on sparc, so it's pretty useless there.
    - use this function on sparc by introducing the DISCOVER_PROG and
      DISCOVER_FUNC variables, preserving the old behavior for all other
      arches. Adjust the debugging messages appropriately.
    - set the default sparc driver to 'sunffb'.
    - set default keyboard rules for sparc to 'xorg' instead of obsolete
      'sun'. The keyboard layer in 2.6 kernels have been unified across
      all arches, so 'xorg' is the correct setting now.
    - add 'cfb' and 'cfb32' to the list of modules loaded by default on
      sparc, since the symbols provided by them are required by sunffb
      driver. Closes: #352869, #377809
    - set the default color depth to 8 for the 'cgsix' driver, as it's the
      maximum depth supported by it.

    symlink at this location to /usr/bin. Packages will still be able to
    install to /usr/X11R6/bin, but they need to be removed from the system
    first so that we can set up the symlink and not drop them out of the path.
    Thanks Steve Langasek. (closes: #362524, #362200)
  * Symlink /usr/X11R6/bin to /usr/bin in x11-common.postinst. Thanks Steve
    Langasek.
  * Several fixes for fonts. Include /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts as a directory
    in x11-common for font packages that have not transitioned to the new
    directory. /usr/lib/X11/fonts symlinks to this directory. Both of these
    used to be symlinks to /usr/share/fonts/X11 but no longer. We explicitly
    remove the symlink at /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts in the x11-common preinst
    to ensure this transition. Thanks Eugene Konev.
  * Document the change of PATH to /usr/X11R6/bin in x11-common NEWS.Debian
    file. Thanks Joey Hess. (closes: #362222)
  * Have x11-common conflict with libxft-dev <= 2.1.8.2-5. Thanks Margarita
    Manterola. (closes: #362255)
  * Document the metapackage name change in x11-common's NEWS.Debian.
  * Have xserver-xorg depend on xbase-clients
  * Ensure that config file md5sum gets migrated from /var/lib/xfree86 to
    /var/libx11. To do so, separate the test for it from the roster file in
    the xserver-xorg preinst. Properly handle the migration itself as well by
    using better variables in the mv command. Thanks Justin Pryzby.
    (closes: #331690)
  * Similarly separate the md5sum for the server symlink from the roster. Also
    handle the case where the server symlink md5sum is removed but the symlink
    itself is in place. Here we just remake the md5sum using that symlink
    silently.

xorg (1:7.0.8) experimental; urgency=low

  * Add vars files for alpha, m68k, mips, mipsel, and arm. These are crude
    currently and definitely need refining from actual porters. If we're
    building useless drivers for your arch and including them in the
    metapackage, let us know and we'll disable them. Thanks Julien Cristau and
    Martin Michlmayr.

 -- David Nusinow <dnusinow@debian.org>  Tue,  4 Apr 2006 23:06:38 -0400

xorg (1:7.0.7) experimental; urgency=low

  * Add x11-common conflicts with monolithic versions of xserver-xorg. This
    will prevent the modular packages from screwing up old installations due
    to a partial install. Thanks Steve Langasek.
  * Add xlibs-static-dev transitional metapackage

 -- David Nusinow <dnusinow@debian.org>  Sun, 26 Mar 2006 19:18:31 -0500

xorg (1:7.0.6) experimental; urgency=low

  * At the urgent request of the release and ftp teams, xlibs must die. Have
    the xserver-xorg package recommend xkb-data instead. xkb-data should
    already be pulled in by several pieces including the xorg metapackage,
    xutils, and xbase-clients
  * Double the font compatibility symlink. One set at /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts
    and one at /usr/lib/X11/fonts. Both point to /usr/share/fonts/X11, which
    is our home for the fonts.

 -- David Nusinow <dnusinow@debian.org>  Tue, 21 Mar 2006 23:29:42 -0500

xorg (1:7.0.5) experimental; urgency=low

xorg (1:7.0.4) experimental; urgency=low

  * Name rgb.txt symlink properly so that the xserver actually finds it.
    Thanks Luca Capello.

 -- David Nusinow <dnusinow@debian.org>  Sun, 12 Mar 2006 12:58:04 -0500

xorg (1:7.0.3) experimental; urgency=low

  * Include rgb.txt from rgb 1.0.0 upstream release. Also provide symlink to
    /usr/share/X11 so that the server knows where to look. Thanks Lukasz
    Panowski. (closes: #356039)
  * Update dexconf for new font location. Thanks Svante Signell.
    (closes: #356181)

 -- David Nusinow <dnusinow@debian.org>  Sat, 11 Mar 2006 19:04:46 -0500

xorg (1:7.0.2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Have xorg-dev only depend on libxaw7-dev, not 6. Thanks Carsten Luedtke.
    (closes: #355703)

 -- David Nusinow <dnusinow@debian.org>  Tue,  7 Mar 2006 20:12:28 -0500

xorg (1:7.0.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * xorg depends on libgl1-mesa-glx now instead of the ubuntu package name.
    Thanks anonymous dude on my blog who should have used reportbug instead.
  * Provide compatibility packages for the Xorg 6.9 mesa packages. This
    package will be the only source of mesa packages in Debian for the
    present, and these packages will provide for smooth upgrades and
    compatibility.
  * Provide versioned dependencies for all the stuff xorg depends on.

 -- David Nusinow <dnusinow@debian.org>  Fri, 24 Feb 2006 01:13:18 -0500

xorg (1:7.0.0) experimental; urgency=low

  * First upload to Debian
  * Add an epoch due to idiocy while working on aborted experimental packages
  * This is a Debian-native package so version it accordingly
  * Remove xbase-clients and xutils metapackages. We're just bundling the apps
    in to one big source package right now
  * Convert to xsfbs
    + shell-lib.sh deleted in favor of xsfbs/xsfbs.sh
    + use targets for script generation and such from xsfbs/xsfbs.mk
  * Change driver metapackage naming to match individual packages:
    + xserver-xorg-driver -> xserver-xorg-video
    + Update the packaging variables that define arch-specific drivers to
      include in the metapackage as well to match these names
  * Remove extra depends on x11-common from xserver-xorg
  * Add debconf dependency for xserver-xorg
  * setuid for /usr/bin/X (stolen from monolith's debian/rules)
  * Provide xlibs and xlibs-data transitional packages. These are empty
    packages that depend on the packages that replace them.
  * Create an xorg metapackage that provides x-window-system(-core). This is a
    simpler name and should suffice. We don't need this split between -system
    and -system-core. If people want twm and so forth they can install it.
    This package installs -core plus xterm currently.
  * Re-add x-window-system-dev package under the new name of xorg-dev. Note to
    packagers: this is not meant to be build-dep'ed on, but is a convenience
    package for users.
  * Provide a compatibility symlink to /usr/lib/X11/fonts (their new home) at
    /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts. This will let external fonts work as expected.
    Thanks Eugene Konev.

  * Support preseeding of xserver-xorg/config/display/default_depth even

  * Remove xserver-xorg-input-wacom from the Depends field of
    xserver-xorg-input-all

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu3) dapper; urgency=low

  * Perform x-common-esque symlink<->dir transitions in x11-common; add

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu2) dapper; urgency=low

  * Add laptop-detect dependency to x11-common, make preinst slightly more,

  * Add dependencies in laptop-detect, xresprobe, mdetect and discover1 to
    xserver-xorg.

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 19 Jan 2006 08:33:23 +1100

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu1) dapper; urgency=low

  * This package now only provides metapackages; we're now modular for real
    real, not for play play.
  * The xlibs, xlibs-data, xlibs-static-dev, xlibs-static-pic, xbase-clients,
    xutils, and x-window-system-dev packages have been removed.  xlibs-dev
    remains.  For now.
  * Merge xserver-common and xorg-common packages into x11-common.
  * Rewrite keyboard detection list to work off d-i keymap only, not language
    too.
  * Drop support for upgrades from pre-sarge, remove support for
    XORG_FORCE_PROBE environment variable.  Remove support for
    non-multiplexed mice in dexconf.
  * Prune unneeded bits of shell-lib.sh (which turns out to be most of it).
  * Move xserver-xorg.config.in detection bits into .postinst.in, so it all
    happens in the one place, and we can use the X server to configure itself
    by detecting its own driver if need be.
  * Move all previous changelog entries to changelog.Debian.old.
  * neomagic is also special, in terms of mode validation on laptops
    (closes: Ubuntu#18957).
  * Move update-linux-hardened-support call from xserver-xorg postinst to
    xserver-xorg-core.
  * Move md5sum/roster directory to /var/lib/x11 from /var/lib/xfree86, and
    use /usr/bin/Xorg, instead of /usr/bin/X11/Xorg.
  * I don't think the following:
     Users of SGI Indigo2 XL machines, or machines with other buses not yet
     fully supported, should specify simply "1" here.  (This is not
     guaranteed to work.)
     was really necessary to have in a Debconf note, so let's remove it.
  * Get rid of write_dri_section question, and just always write it.
  * Replace $NOPROBE with $AUTODETECT_VIDEO, and $DOPROBE with $UPGRADE,
    inverting the senses of both variables.
  * Remove support for DEBUG_XFREE86_* variables (has been DEBUG_XORG_* for a
    while now).
  * Remove compatibility code for xresprobe < 0.4.13.
  * Remove long-unused 'are you on an LCD?' question.
  * Don't touch the config file when we're upgrading.  Specific migrations
    needed can be done in-place.
  * Add seconds to the backup xorg.conf file's name, so you can do multiple
    reconfigures in the same minute.
  * Remove language -> keymap 'smarts'.
  * Make xserver-xorg depend on either the full set of drivers
    (xserver-xorg-driver-all, xserver-xorg-input-all), or any individual
    driver (xserver-xorg-driver, xserver-xorg-input).
  * Remove all dependencies on -driver-atimisc, as it is part of -ati.
  * Nuke irrelevant history section and segue into xf86cfg description from
    dexconf's manpage, update XF86Config-4 references to talk about xorg.conf
    instead.
  * Remove code which checked if a given directory didn't exist ... right
    after it ensured it had been created.
  * Change default mouse protocol to ExplorerPS/2 (closes: Ubuntu#4106).
  * Remove support in dexconf for CID fonts, since mkcfm is wildly non-free.
  * Remove support for ZAxisMapping.
  * Ensure GLcore is removed from the module list when upgrading.
  * Remove XFree86 history spiel from x11-common description.
  * Add /usr/X11R6/bin/X -> /usr/bin/X link.
  * Ask the 'which server?' question at priority low.
  * Remove hppa's hardcoded null _INPUT_DEPENDS, as the libdl-based loader has
    dragged the rest of this architecture kicking and screaming into 1983.
    Unfortunately LaMont is still stuck in 1975, but you can't expect me to
    fix that.

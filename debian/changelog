xorg (7.0.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * First upload to Debian
  * Remove xbase-clients and xutils metapackages. We're just bundling the apps
    in to one big source package right now
  * Convert to xsfbs
    + shell-lib.sh deleted in favor of xsfbs/xsfbs.sh
    + use targets for script generation and such from xsfbs/xsfbs.mk
  * Change driver metapackage naming to match individual packages:
    + xserver-xorg-driver -> xorg-video-driver
    + xserver-xorg-input -> xorg-input-driver
    + Update the packaging variables that define arch-specific drivers to
      include in the metapackage as well to match these names

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu14) dapper; urgency=low

  * Support preseeding of xserver-xorg/config/display/default_depth even
    when autodetecting video. (Unfortunately, this will mean that people get
    the wrong default presented on second and subsequent low-priority
    reconfigures, though.)

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu13) dapper; urgency=low

  * Would be nice if we would still exit 0, however...

 -- Adam Conrad <adconrad@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 31 Jan 2006 09:48:00 +0000

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu12) dapper; urgency=low

  * Make /etc/init.d/x11-common completely silent unless running VERBOSE.

 -- Adam Conrad <adconrad@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 30 Jan 2006 15:03:15 +0000

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu11) dapper; urgency=low

  * Fix first-installation logic to cope with being called from the postinst
    too (closes: Malone #29564).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 27 Jan 2006 18:22:46 +0000

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu10) dapper; urgency=low

  * Remove xserver-xorg-driver-v4l and xserver-xorg-driver-glide from the
    Depends field of xserver-xorg-driver-all
  * Remove xserver-xorg-input-wacom from the Depends field of
    xserver-xorg-input-all
  * Add zlib1g-dev to the dependency list of xlibs-dev and remove
    xlibs-static-dev, since the latter no longer exists.

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu9) dapper; urgency=low

  * Re-add xutils and xbase-clients metapackages.

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 20 Jan 2006 16:39:24 +1100

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu8) dapper; urgency=low

  * Add xserver-xorg-driver-sisusb to amd64, i386 and powerpc; add
    -driver-voodoo to amd64 and i386.

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 20 Jan 2006 15:27:03 +1100

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu7) dapper; urgency=low

  * Add dh_install call to binary-arch instead of just being in -indep
    (thanks, Andres Salomon).

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 20 Jan 2006 10:21:13 +1100

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu6) dapper; urgency=low

  * Change xserver-xorg's dependency on x-common to x11-common.

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 20 Jan 2006 01:39:58 +1100

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu5) dapper; urgency=low

  * Also check that /usr/bin/X11 isn't a symlink, since -d covers both
    directories, and symlinks to directories.

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 20 Jan 2006 00:00:58 +1100

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu4) dapper; urgency=low

  * Clean debian/local/X instead of debian/local/xserver-wrapper, and make
    x11-common Arch: any instead of all.  I am clever.  (closes: Malone#28967)

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 19 Jan 2006 23:00:03 +1100

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu3) dapper; urgency=low

  * Perform x-common-esque symlink<->dir transitions in x11-common; add
    Conflicts on x-common.
  * Trim default set of input drivers down to evdev, keyboard, mouse, wacom.
  * Rejig handling of x-window-system-core depends.

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 19 Jan 2006 17:06:53 +1100

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu2) dapper; urgency=low

  * Add laptop-detect dependency to x11-common, make preinst slightly more,
    er, robust, in the face of failure (closes: Malone#28911).
  * Add dependencies in laptop-detect, xresprobe, mdetect and discover1 to
    xserver-xorg.

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 19 Jan 2006 08:33:23 +1100

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu1) dapper; urgency=low

  * This package now only provides metapackages; we're now modular for real
    real, not for play play.
  * The xlibs, xlibs-data, xlibs-static-dev, xlibs-static-pic, xbase-clients,
    xutils, and x-window-system-dev packages have been removed.  xlibs-dev
    remains.  For now.
  * Merge xserver-common and xorg-common packages into x11-common.
  * Rewrite keyboard detection list to work off d-i keymap only, not language
    too.
  * Drop support for upgrades from pre-sarge, remove support for
    XORG_FORCE_PROBE environment variable.  Remove support for
    non-multiplexed mice in dexconf.
  * Prune unneeded bits of shell-lib.sh (which turns out to be most of it).
  * Move xserver-xorg.config.in detection bits into .postinst.in, so it all
    happens in the one place, and we can use the X server to configure itself
    by detecting its own driver if need be.
  * Move all previous changelog entries to changelog.Debian.old.
  * neomagic is also special, in terms of mode validation on laptops
    (closes: Ubuntu#18957).
  * Move update-linux-hardened-support call from xserver-xorg postinst to
    xserver-xorg-core.
  * Move md5sum/roster directory to /var/lib/x11 from /var/lib/xfree86, and
    use /usr/bin/Xorg, instead of /usr/bin/X11/Xorg.
  * I don't think the following:
     Users of SGI Indigo2 XL machines, or machines with other buses not yet
     fully supported, should specify simply "1" here.  (This is not
     guaranteed to work.)
     was really necessary to have in a Debconf note, so let's remove it.
  * Get rid of write_dri_section question, and just always write it.
  * Replace $NOPROBE with $AUTODETECT_VIDEO, and $DOPROBE with $UPGRADE,
    inverting the senses of both variables.
  * Remove support for DEBUG_XFREE86_* variables (has been DEBUG_XORG_* for a
    while now).
  * Remove compatibility code for xresprobe < 0.4.13.
  * Remove long-unused 'are you on an LCD?' question.
  * Don't touch the config file when we're upgrading.  Specific migrations
    needed can be done in-place.
  * Add seconds to the backup xorg.conf file's name, so you can do multiple
    reconfigures in the same minute.
  * Remove language -> keymap 'smarts'.
  * Make xserver-xorg depend on either the full set of drivers
    (xserver-xorg-driver-all, xserver-xorg-input-all), or any individual
    driver (xserver-xorg-driver, xserver-xorg-input).
  * Remove all dependencies on -driver-atimisc, as it is part of -ati.
  * Nuke irrelevant history section and segue into xf86cfg description from
    dexconf's manpage, update XF86Config-4 references to talk about xorg.conf
    instead.
  * Remove code which checked if a given directory didn't exist ... right
    after it ensured it had been created.
  * Change default mouse protocol to ExplorerPS/2 (closes: Ubuntu#4106).
  * Remove support in dexconf for CID fonts, since mkcfm is wildly non-free.
  * Remove support for ZAxisMapping.
  * Ensure GLcore is removed from the module list when upgrading.
  * Remove XFree86 history spiel from x11-common description.
  * Add /usr/X11R6/bin/X -> /usr/bin/X link.
  * Ask the 'which server?' question at priority low.
  * Remove hppa's hardcoded null _INPUT_DEPENDS, as the libdl-based loader has
    dragged the rest of this architecture kicking and screaming into 1983.
    Unfortunately LaMont is still stuck in 1975, but you can't expect me to
    fix that.

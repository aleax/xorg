Description: X Window System (X.Org) infrastructure
 x11-common contains the filesystem infrastructure required for further
 installation of the X Window System in any configuration; it does not
 provide a full installation of clients, servers, libraries, and utilities
 required to run the X Window System.
 .
 A number of terms are used to refer to the X Window System, including "X", "X
 Version 11", "X11", "X11R6", and "X11R7".  The version of X used in Debian and
 Ubuntu is derived from the version released by the X.Org Foundation, and is
 thus often also referred to as "X.Org".  All of the preceding quoted terms are
 functionally interchangeable in an Ubuntu system.

Description: the X.Org X server
 This package depends on the full suite of the server and drivers for the
 X.Org X server, as well as providing a configuration infrastructure to manage
 xorg.conf.  It does not provide the actual server itself, but removing it
 is strongly discouraged.

Package: xserver-xorg-driver-all

Depends: ${F:XServer-Xorg-Driver-Depends}
Description: the X.Org X server -- output driver metapackage
 This package depends on the full suite of output drivers for the X.Org X server
 (Xorg).  It does not provide any drivers itself, and may be removed if you wish
 to only have certain drivers installed.

Package: xserver-xorg-input-all
Architecture: alpha amd64 arm hppa hurd-i386 i386 ia64 m68k mips mipsel powerpc sparc
Depends: ${F:XServer-Xorg-Input-Depends}
Description: the X.Org X server -- input driver metapackage
 This package depends on the full suite of input drivers for the X.Org X server
 (Xorg).  It does not provide any drivers itself, and may be removed if you wish
 to only have certain drivers installed.

Description: X Window System core components
 This metapackage provides the essential components for a standalone
 workstation running the X Window System.  It provides the X libraries, an X
 server, a set of fonts, and a group of basic X clients and utilities.
 .
 Higher level metapackages, such as those for desktop environments, can
 depend on this package and simplify their dependencies.
 .
 It should be noted that a package providing x-window-manager and a package
 providing x-terminal-emulator should also be installed to ensure a
 comfortable X experience.

Description: X Window System (X.Org) infrastructure
 x11-common contains the filesystem infrastructure required for further
 installation of the X Window System in any configuration; it does not
 provide a full installation of clients, servers, libraries, and utilities
 required to run the X Window System.
 .
 A number of terms are used to refer to the X Window System, including "X",
 "X Version 11", "X11", "X11R6", and "X11R7".  The version of X used in
 Debian is derived from the version released by the X.Org Foundation, and
 is thus often also referred to as "X.Org".  All of the preceding quoted
 terms are functionally interchangeable in an Debian system.

Description: the X.Org X server
 This package depends on the full suite of the server and drivers for the
 X.Org X server, as well as providing a configuration infrastructure to manage
 xorg.conf.  It does not provide the actual server itself, but removing it
 is strongly discouraged.

 to only have certain drivers installed.

Description: X.Org X Window System
 This metapackage provides the components for a standalone
 workstation running the X Window System.  It provides the X libraries, an X
 server, a set of fonts, and a group of basic X clients and utilities.
 .
 Higher level metapackages, such as those for desktop environments, can
 depend on this package and simplify their dependencies.
 .
 It should be noted that a package providing x-window-manager should also
 be installed to ensure a comfortable X experience.

Description: the X.Org development libraries
 This metapackage provides the development libraries for the X.Org X Window
 System.
 .
 X Window System design documentation, manual pages, library reference
 works, unstripped and static versions of the shared libraries, C header
 files, and special versions of libraries available only in static form
 (with and without PIC symbols included) are supplied by the packages
 depended on by this metapackage.
 .
 Note that this is a convinience package for users and is not a package for
 Debian developers to have their package depend on.

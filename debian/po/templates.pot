"Because the X server runs with superuser privileges, it may be unwise to "
"permit any user to start it, for security reasons.  On the other hand, it is "
"even more unwise to run general-purpose X client programs as root, which is "
"what may happen if only root is permitted to start the X server.  A good "
"compromise is to permit the X server to be started only by users logged in "
"to one of the virtual consoles."

"When using operating system kernels with a particular scheduling strategy, "

"run at a higher process priority than the default; a process's priority is "
"known as its \"nice\" value.  These values range from -20 (extremely high "
"priority, or \"not nice\" to other processes) to 19 (extremely low "
"priority).  The default nice value for ordinary processes is 0, and this is "
"also the recommend value for the X server."

"Some users have reported that upon upgrade to the current package set, their "

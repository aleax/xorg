Bulletproof-X
-------------

This is a failsafe-mode for Xorg, that will be called when Xorg is
unable to start due to misconfiguration.

This functionality is dependent on displayconfig-gtk, and requires some
changes to gdm.conf.  These can be achieved as follows:

   sudo apt-get install displayconfig-gtk
   sudo failsafeInstall


Todo
====
   * Fallback to "vga" where vesa won't work.  So far I've not succeeded
     in getting vga started in anything better than 320x200, which is
     unusable, so fallback is not currently enabled.
   * Apply the gdm config changes to gdm.conf
   * Drop failsafeInstall and update this README

## Video drivers

### Intel driver

 * *Why isn’t it working?*  
   KMS is mandatory, as documented in its `README.Debian` (view it
   online:
   [git.debian.org](http://git.debian.org/?p=pkg-xorg/driver/xserver-xorg-video-intel.git;a=blob;f=debian/README.Debian)). You
   probably disabled KMS or didn’t include it in your kernel
   configuration if you’re using a custom kernel.

 * *X is crashing all the time with my “old” Intel card. What can I do?*  
   Unfortunately, old cards are not very well supported, and you can’t
   do much more than switching to a generic driver, like `fbdev` or
   `vesa`, as documented in `README.Debian` (view it online:
   [git.debian.org](http://git.debian.org/?p=pkg-xorg/driver/xserver-xorg-video-intel.git;a=blob;f=debian/README.Debian)). Please
   note that you need to disable `KMS` if you want to use the `vesa`
   driver. A minimal `xorg.conf` would look like:

        Section "Device"
            Identifier "MyBuggyCard"
            Driver     "fbdev"
        EndSection


### Nouveau driver

 * *Why isn’t it working?*  
   Since it’s still considered experimental by its authors, the
   interfaces aren’t stable yet, so the driver has particular
   dependencies on the kernel, which are documented in `README.Debian`
   (view it online:
   [for squeeze](http://git.debian.org/?p=pkg-xorg/driver/xserver-xorg-video-nouveau.git;a=blob;f=debian/README.Debian;h=27ced6b1bf5102a5b72525318439efdfb330745d;hb=6c2f12ca18f55b55d49e083d86d87d970ce53a07),
   [for sid](http://git.debian.org/?p=pkg-xorg/driver/xserver-xorg-video-nouveau.git;a=blob;f=debian/README.Debian)).


## Others

### Session management

 * *How to start a bare X session (without Gnome, KDE, etc.)?*  
   Assuming there’s no X running on the `:1` display, run this from a
   VT:

        startx /usr/bin/xterm -- :1
